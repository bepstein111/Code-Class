    "# Hello World (1972)\n",
    "Making the computer “speak,” and say hello, is often the first task done when learning to program in an imperative programming language. The “Hello World” program, on some levels, frames the computer as obedient, autonomous, and able to communicate verbally, albeit in a very simple way. It is a simple program to show that a programming environment has been set up and running properly. \n",

    "The line is a reference to Miranda’s exclamation “O brave new world” in <i>The Tempest</i>. While “Hello World” (with or without a comma or exclamation point, capitalized variously) is the most famous first text to have the computer display, alternate traditions have arisen.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL), a different text was some- times substituted: “Hello Sailor.” While helping to establish a distinct body of Stanford computing lore and customs, this was also a loaded phrase, evoking a sexual proposition that was often thought to be used by prostitutes soliciting nautical customers. It may also suggest a sexual solicitation by someone, male or female, who is not a prostitute. \n",
    "\n",
    "If “Hello World” suggests the wonder of Miranda, finally in contact with the amazing wide and inhabited environment, “Hello, Sailor” suggests a very different, jaded perspective—and perhaps a campy one. The phrase is well-known enough to have been in used as a book title more than once, in the 1997 book “Hello, Sailor”: Changing Perspectives of Japanese Prostitution: A Historical Analysis and the 2003 book Hello Sailor!: The Hidden History of Gay Life at Sea. -p84, Montfort"

It’s not enough to just exchange one string for another. The eternal “Buh-bye” program, with a justification for why it is a valuable introduction to computing, would be one legitimate solution."

    "# Temperature Conversion\n",
    "Converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius is often the first mathematical function implemented by new programmers. A conversion program demonstrates how compu- tation is general—how it can work on arbitrary values. But this is also a very practical program, for an important reason: measurement systems are culturally situated and, when people encounter a temperature display or a fixed value from particular different culture, it is necessary to convert from one scale to another.\n",
    "The United States and a very few other places still use the Fahrenheit scale. "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Background\n",
    "The Celsius measurement system, devised by astronomer Anders Celsius, seems to be particularly well-calibrated in a culturally neutral way. The scale was set (until the middle of the twentieth century) so that 0 is the freezing point of water and 100 is the boiling point. Water freezes and boils at different altitudes and pressures, so sea level and mean barometric pressure was specified. This scale was first formulated in 1742.\n",
    "\n",
    "The older Fahrenheit scale, is also calibrated with regard to the natural world, but somewhat differently. Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, the inventor of the glass-contained mercury thermometer, devised this temperature scale based on the human body. In 1724, he determined that 0 would be set to the temperature which was thought, at the time, to be the coldest possible— the freezing point of brine (a mixture of equal parts ice, water, and ammonium chloride). The 32-degree point was the freezing point of water (measured by the same process, just without the ammonium chloride), and the 96-degree point was set at the temperature of a healthy human body, or “blood-heat.” The scale was later recalibrated, but this seems to be how it was set up initially. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although we might consider a scale running from 0 to 100 as more obviously useful today, the 64 points between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 96 degrees Fahrenheit were carefully considered in the construction of the scale. Fahrenheit could simply determine the midpoint of that interval, physically marked on glass, and then divide each segment in half again. After six such divisions, he would have all the markings from 32 to 96 made.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Celsius certainly seems to be the more reasonable and well-grounded temperature scale, the Fahrenheit scale has some advantages for everyday use. If a person is wondering what temperature it is outside, it’s usually enough, to know that the Fahrenheit measurement is in the twenties, thirties, forties, fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties, or nineties. A single digit (the first one) captures enough to inform someone about what to wear. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Celsius, that range extends from about -7 to 37, and it’s not very helpful to know only the first digit of the temperature. So, awkwardly calibrated as the Fahrenheit scale is, it arguably is better suited to at least some of our common experiences of temperature, at least in this one way. One could make the argument that it’s on a more human scale, good for distinguishing between temperatures that we usually encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specifics of these temperature scales are somewhat interesting, but perhaps most interesting is that they, like so many measurement systems, do not exist as mathematical abstractions. They are determined by <i>convention, law, and national norms</i>. As soon as we encounter the power of the computer as a pure calculating machine and begin to imagine its rarefied existence apart from matters of mere humanity— we are shown an example of how <b>computation can be used for mediating between the cultural norms of different measurement systems</b>. While we might want to imagine detached, abstract, perfect and pure logic and mathematics, what we have instead is Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit slapping a thermometer up against a healthy man’s armpit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code also demonstrates an example of polymorphism. To  explictly ensure that precision arithmetic calculation is performed rather than integer aritmetic, we use a floating point decimal in the function definition.  \n"
